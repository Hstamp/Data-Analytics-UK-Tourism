# Data-Analytics-UK-Tourism
A data analytics and machine learning project using UK Tourism data from the Office of National Statistics

## Summary 
Presented are the Jupyter Notebooks of a Data Analytics project undertaken for MSc Data Analytics module. 

Using data available from the Office for National Statistics on UK Tourism, we aimed to build a prediction model to determine whether a tourist is likely to travel independently or in organised packages.
In general, this distinction is important to everyone contributing to the tourism infrastructure and to everyone designing holiday offers as the needs of both types of travellers can be quite diverse.

See files for a full data analysis project cycle, including data cleaning and transformation, visualisation and prediction modelling.

The data is free to access and can be downloaded from the ONS website: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/datasets/travelpac
